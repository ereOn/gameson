# GameSON

A game-oriented serialization format and types.

## Goals & Non-goals

GameSON is Rust library that helps you define and implement a dynamic type
system, to exchange structured data between game clients, game servers and
backend services. It contains generic structures that can be used to represent
and parse various data-types as well as facilities to implement your own
backend system.

It is not a communication protocol nor does it handle game objects replication.
